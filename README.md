PACMAN is a game which you have played in your chilhood or some of you would still playing it. As it is an interesting game so we made it by using new technologies and libraries.

We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end purpose and used some algorithms like "Maze-generation Algorithm" which generate the maze of PACMAN in a recursive manner.

We used p5.js for the designing purpose of maze.

For back-end, we used Java, Jsp as a server-side languages and MySql database.

We made all things by scratch.
