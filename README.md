## Pacman
                                          
PACMAN is one of the popular game which you must have played in your childhood days or some of you are still playing it. As it is an interesting game so we made it by using new technologies and libraries.

We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end purpose and used some algorithms like "Maze-generation Algorithm" which generate the maze of PACMAN in a recursive manner.

We used p5.js for the designing purpose of maze.

For back-end, we used Java, Jsp as a server-side languages and MySql database.

We have implemented everything from scratch.
